# Pseudorange residue
Pseudorange residuals are differences between the measured pseudorange and the expected pseudorange in a satellite-based positioning system, such as GPS. They provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the positioning solution.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Pseudorange**: 
   - A pseudorange is the estimated distance from a GPS receiver to a satellite, calculated based on the time it takes for a signal to travel from the satellite to the receiver. It includes the actual distance as well as errors due to factors like satellite clock errors, atmospheric delays, and multipath effects.

2. **Residual Calculation**:
   - The pseudorange residual is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Residual} = \text{Measured Pseudorange} - \text{Expected Pseudorange}
     \]
   - The expected pseudorange is typically based on the geometric position of the satellites and the calculated position of the receiver.

3. **Error Detection**:
   - Analyzing pseudorange residuals helps identify errors in the positioning solution. Large residuals may indicate problems such as poor satellite geometry, multipath interference, or incorrect clock settings.

4. **Quality Assessment**:
   - By monitoring the residuals over time, users can assess the quality of the GPS data. Consistent low residuals suggest a reliable positioning solution, while high or erratic residuals may signal issues that need to be addressed.

5. **Applications**:
   - Pseudorange residuals are commonly used in applications like surveying, geodesy, and high-precision navigation to improve positioning accuracy and assess the performance of GPS receivers.

In summary, pseudorange residuals are crucial for understanding the performance of GPS and other satellite positioning systems, helping users evaluate the accuracy of their location data and troubleshoot potential issues.
