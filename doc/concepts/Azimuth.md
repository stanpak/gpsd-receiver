In a geopositioning system, **satellite azimuth** refers to the angle between a reference direction (usually true north) and the direction to a satellite, measured clockwise around the observer’s horizon. 

In practical terms, if you're standing at a certain location on Earth and you want to find out where a satellite is in the sky, the azimuth gives you the compass direction you need to look. It is measured in degrees from 0° to 360°, where:

- 0° corresponds to true north
- 90° corresponds to east
- 180° corresponds to south
- 270° corresponds to west

Understanding satellite azimuth is crucial for applications like satellite communications, navigation, and remote sensing, as it helps determine the optimal positioning of antennas and receivers to maintain a line of sight with the satellite.
