In the context of the Global Positioning System (GPS), the PRN (Pseudo-Random Noise) ID is a unique identifier assigned to each satellite in the constellation. It is used to differentiate between the signals transmitted by different satellites. 

PRN IDs are typically numbers ranging from 1 to 32 for the Block I, II, and III satellites. Each satellite transmits a distinct signal that can be recognized by GPS receivers, allowing them to calculate their position based on signals from multiple satellites. 

For example, PRN ID 1 corresponds to the first GPS satellite, while PRN ID 2 corresponds to the second, and so on. Each satellite's PRN ID can change as satellites are decommissioned and new ones are launched.

The PRN code is pseudo-random because it appears random but is generated using a deterministic algorithm. This allows for reliable identification and correlation of the signals, enabling accurate positioning. Each satellite's PRN code is designed to have specific properties, such as low cross-correlation with the codes of other satellites, which minimizes interference and improves the accuracy of the positioning information received by GNSS receivers.
