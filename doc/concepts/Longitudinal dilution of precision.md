The Longitudinal Dilution of Precision (LDOP) is a measure used in Global Positioning System (GPS) and other satellite navigation systems to describe the geometric accuracy of a position fix. It specifically focuses on the impact of the satellite geometry on the accuracy of the longitude component of the position solution.

In GPS, the accuracy of a position fix depends on the relative positions of the satellites being used to calculate that fix. When satellites are well-distributed across the sky, the position accuracy is generally higher. However, when satellites are clustered closely together or are positioned in a way that does not provide good angular separation, the accuracy can degrade. 

LDOP is one of several Dilution of Precision (DOP) factors, which also include:

- **Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP)**: Relates to the horizontal accuracy (latitude and longitude).
- **Vertical Dilution of Precision (VDOP)**: Relates to the vertical accuracy (altitude).
- **Time Dilution of Precision (TDOP)**: Relates to the accuracy of the time component in the position fix.

A lower LDOP value indicates better potential accuracy in the longitudinal position, while a higher value indicates poorer potential accuracy. DOP values are usually expressed as a unitless ratio; lower values (typically below 2) are ideal for precise positioning, while values above 6 may indicate less reliable results.
